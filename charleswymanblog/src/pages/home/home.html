            This is my portfolio web page. I am a software developer that specializes in creating web applications. What web developer doesn't have a portfolio site, right? The site is designed to be responsive from the ground up and to provide the user access to an in-depth version of my resume, examples of my art, links to different apps and sites that I have made, and provide a contact form for contacting me. The site itself should showcase engaging features and design. Also, a blog has been included to show how easy it is to write one from scratch today without even needing to resort to WordPress.

            The cards below provide links to different pages. There is a blog page for containing my thoughts about different things. There is an art page which has thumbnails of different designs that I have done through the years, which can be clicked to be expanded and zoomed in on. The 'About' page contains a copy of my resume, and the 'Contact' page provides a contact form for sending me e-mails.
